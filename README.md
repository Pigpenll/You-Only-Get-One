# You-Only-Get-One
For the You Only Get One Game Jam in class.

Created 2d top-down 'survival' RPG from scratch. Features cutscenes and animations to tell story, resource management and basic interactive and movement mechanics. Sound effects and music, exploration, functional menus, art assets and more. ALL sprites and audio are made from scratch. Followed theme with story and concept. 

# One Life
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2025

## Theme
We centered the story around the player and a plant they have that retains a lot of emotional value. It's a post-apocalyptic setting and the player has to choose either themself or the plant to save. They can only save one life. 

## Game Play
Survive. Decide what you want to live. 
Basic movement and exploration through a house. NPC and object interactions. 

## Impediments
Considerable technical difficulties overall. Our efficiency was greatly impeded by the amount of time we spent just getting access to other people's implementations. Took time to get used to working collaboratively. Some members also experiences a lot of issues with simply accessing Unity. 

## Implementation
Cutscene animations. Basic movement. Character moving animations. Finite resource management. Object and NPC interactions. Time progression. Functional menus and an intro sequence. Camera follows player. Small but interactive level to explore. Story elements the player can influence. 
All sprites and sounds are custom made.
