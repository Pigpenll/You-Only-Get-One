=== bad_ending ===
You find your daughter crumpled in the corner, her tiny arms wrapped around the dead plant.

The sapling's withered stem bends under the dry wind.

She whispers, "I thought we still had time..."

You sit beside her, unable to find words.

Outside, the world remains silent and dead.

Hope... gone.

-> END
