You kneel with your daughter in the dust.

Together, you press the glowing seed into the cracked earth.

For a moment, nothing.

Then — a surge of green, a breath of life.

She clutches your arm, tears streaking her dirtied face.

"Daddy... we did it."

The sun rises, and for the first time in years... it’s warm.
