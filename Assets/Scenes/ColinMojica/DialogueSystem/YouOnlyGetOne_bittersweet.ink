=== bittersweet_ending ===
You stand alone outside your broken home.

The glowing seed pulses weakly in your hands.

You kneel and plant it into the earth.

Slowly, a green vine unfurls, blossoming against the endless grey.

You smile faintly, but the house behind you is silent.

There is life again... but at a price.

-> END
